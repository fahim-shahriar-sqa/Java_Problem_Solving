# Java Programming Solutions

**Java Programming Solutions** is a curated collection of Java programs designed to solve a variety of programming problems. Each solution is encapsulated in a standalone Java class named using the pattern `Problem_X_ClassName`, where **X** represents the problem number and **ClassName** reflects the purpose of the class.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project includes **45 Java programming problems** that cover a broad range of topics â€” from basic arithmetic to intermediate-level data structure manipulations. Each solution is carefully written to demonstrate good programming practices and is supplemented with comments for easy understanding.
